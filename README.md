This is a quick example of how to use Vue Styleguidist and the vue-docgen-cli. As well as a bit on generating the documentation at runtime, without manual intervention. There is also a YouTube video covering how to do this here: 
# documentation-generator

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
